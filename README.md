# PyTessy - Tesseract-OCR, faster!

This module allows faster access to Tesseract-OCR from Python scripts.

## Quick start
This repository integrate changes from following [pytessy](https://github.com/hyperrixel/pytessy) forks:
* [sydneyprovence/pytessy](https://github.com/sydneyprovence/pytessy)
* [tbattz/pytessy](https://github.com/tbattz/pytessy)
* [jevgienij/pytessy](https://github.com/jevgienij/pytessy) (2020 patches)

It adds two quick 'hacks' to enable more functionality.

* Allows pytessy to be used within a Jupyter notebook
* Allows using pytessy on Linux

Note that you may need to import pytessy before/after importing numpy, as there seems to be something conflicting when importing in a certain order.

On linux, install tesseract and get the trained data.
```bash
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
wget https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/master/eng.traineddata
sudo mkdir /usr/share/tessdata/ 
sudo mv eng.traineddata /usr/share/tessdata/
```
Run the example usage script.
```bash
python3 exampleUsage.py
```
Or run the following
```python
from source import pytessy
from PIL import ImageFilter, Image

# Create pytessy instance
ocrReader = pytessy.PyTessy()

files = ["testImages/testWord.png", "testImages/5.4321.png"]

for file in files:
    # Load Image
    img = Image.open(file)

    # Scale up image
    w, h = img.size
    img = img.resize((2 * w, 2 * h))
    # Sharpen image
    img = img.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN)
    # Convert to ctypes
    imgBytes = img.tobytes()
    bytesPerPixel = int(len(imgBytes) / (img.width * img.height))
    # Use OCR on Image
    imageStr = ocrReader.read(img.tobytes(), img.width, img.height, bytesPerPixel, raw=True, resolution=600)

    print(file, imageStr)
```


## Why and when is it so fast?

PyTessy uses direct library-level access to Tesseract-OCR's core library. Therefore is it so fast in case when the image is already in the memory or when the image need to be processed before scanning with Tesseract-OCR. In case of reading and scanning existing files only PyTessy is just a bit faster than usual Tesseract-OCR Python wrappers.

## Requirements

### Operating system

PyTessy is operating system independent in case if you set the exact location of your Tesseract-OCR library since presently library search process is implemented on Windows only.

### Python modules

PyTessy uses only modules from the Standard Library only. Python version must be ` >= 3.6 `.

### External requirements

You have to have installed or portable version of Tesseract-OCR (at least a working library and ` tessdata `).

You can download Tesseract-OCR from [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Downloads).

## Installation

You can install the latest PyTessy version with ` pip install pytessy ` or you can download the wheel from this repository or you can build it from the source code.

## Documentation

PyTessy has a [ReadTheDocs page](https://pytessy.readthedocs.io/)
